# MacUserGenerator

A Mac utility that assists in automating the creation of macOS User Accounts.

**MacUserGenerator** (MUG) is written from the ground up, with ideas ***heavily*** inspired from [MagerValp's](https://github.com/MagerValp) [CreateUserPkg](https://github.com/MagerValp/CreateUserPkg):

### * macOS Mojave 10.14 Caveats:

*   Supported when [System Integrity Protection (SIP)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899) is **disabled**
*   When SIP is **enabled**, attempting to update the **User ID** and **Home Directory** attributes will result in the following prompts:

    | **Scripts**                                                | **Packages**                                                 |

## Under the hood (the nerdy stuff)
*   Export a user account as a **Python script (PY):**
    *   The user account password is hashed using [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2). Your password does not appear in plain text anywhere!
    *   The user account picture is embedded into the python script (base64). No need for a separate image file!
*   Export a user account as an **Installer Package (PKG):**
    *   Package is payload free - it uses the script export mentioned above as a **postinstall** script within the package.
    *   Package will be signed with a [Developer ID Installer Certificate](https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/) (if selected) during export:

## Things I would love some help with
*   [ ]   Ability for the user account to be allowed to unlock FileVault (FDE).
